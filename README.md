# PGM_Assignment
My Probabilistic Graphical Models ML Computer Science Honours assignment. 

This assigment's objective was to use Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) to solve a real world problem in the field of our choice.

## File Outline:

Bayesian.ipynb : This file contains the code for training and tesing the final model.  

data.ipynb: This file conatins code used to analyse, visualise and preprocess the data.  

CrossValidation.ipynb: This file contains the code that performs the cross validation for all the year's data.  

BayesianExperimentaion.ipynb: This file was used to experiment with different techniques while keeping the model in Bayesian.ipynb unaffected.  

Gaussian.ipynb: This file contains the attempt at the Gaussian Bayesian Network for continuous data.  

YearModelComparison.ipynb: This file conatins code to evaluate the model on each year's data with out cross validation.  

preprocessing.py: This file contains a class with functions to help preprocess the data.  

ModelEvaluation.py: This file contains a class with functions to help evaluate the model.
